# Optimization-CaseStudy
This is a case study on the efficiency/robustness of multi-objective and single objective optimization algorithms implemented on the Schwefel test function.

To run the code, take the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/Optimization-CaseStudy/blob/main/requirements.txt)
and run the code. If you are not sure how to do so follow this [Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/Career-Cheat-Sheets/blob/main/Development-Environment/PythonVirtualEnvironment.md) guide.
