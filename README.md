# Optimization-CaseStudy
This is a case study on the efficiency/robustness of multi-objective and single objective optimization algorithms implemented on the Schwefel test function. For a summary on the results and an in-depth explanation of different solver configurations see this [document](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/Optimization-CaseStudy/blob/main/Optimization%20Algorithms%20Performance%20Case%20Study.pdf).

To run the code, take the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/Optimization-CaseStudy/blob/main/requirements.txt)
and run the code. If you are not sure how to do so follow this [Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/Career-Cheat-Sheets/blob/main/Development-Environment/PythonVirtualEnvironment.md) guide.
